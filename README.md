Hello folks :D

Here is one of the first release of the german translation for the game Banished.

Sorry for all the typos, I build this translation with notepad++.



Download a copy of this Translation.

Put the files into a folder named like translationGerman.

Add now this lines to your 'BuildExamples.bat' at you BanishedKit folder.

bin\Tools-x64.exe /build Package.rsc:list /pathres ../example/translationGerman /pathdat ../example/translationGerman/bin
bin\Tools-x64.exe /mod Package.rsc:translationGerman /pathres ../example/translationGerman /pathdat ../example/translationGerman/bin


Build it and have Fun.
